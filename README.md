# High Temp

## Mission Statement
High Temp is the site for anyone with a sweet tooth; we sell Pastries, Gourmet Candies, Custom Cakes, and even ingredient kits for people who want to make our recipes at home. 

## Approach Taken
I set out to create a site with CRUD capabilities for customers to buy sweets and order custom desserts. I focused mainly on the front-end due to issues with my Postgres database. 

## Wireframe

## Technologies Used
- Spring/Maven
- React
- PostgresQL

## Unsolved Problems
I was unable to get POST or GET requests to work correctly with my database. I will continue to work on this, I'd like it to be fully fleshed out in the future. 

## Live Site
This site is deployed through Netlify and will continue to be updated there: https://keen-sammet-1c6b61.netlify.app
