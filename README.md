# High Temp

## Mission Statement
High Temp is the site for anyone with a sweet tooth; we sell Pastries, Gourmet Candies, Custom Cakes, and even ingredient kits for people who want to make our recipes at home. 

## MVP
Users should be able to click through each categorical page of desserts (react-router), and create a list of items they want (wishlist/shopping cart), read the most updated page of desserts, update the wishlist, and delete items from the list if they want. The home page, wishlist page, and dessert pages will each be views.

## Libraries
I want to try to use the Dojo Toolkit for this web app; it includes UI elements, makes AJAX easier to use, and supports client-side data storage.

## Post MVP
My post MVP would be allowing users to login, share their wishlist with others, and making the site look visually stunning.

## Timeline
  - Set up SQL database, create-react-app, create MVC template thing, decide on APIs to create
  - Start creating components; decide what needs to hold state and what does not
  - Finish creation of components; link API and DB to app
  - Work in depth on UI components and start testing API calls and such
  - TBD
